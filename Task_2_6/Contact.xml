         Even in an always-connected world, we may not be always ready to 
         read something interesting that comes its way. The FOMORS (fear 
         of missing out reading something) once led to a profusion of “read it 
         later” services. These let you easily store an article for later review 
         at your leisure. An article might be a formal piece of journalism, 
         a blog entry, a recipe, or anything page oriented, no matter 
         how long or short.
