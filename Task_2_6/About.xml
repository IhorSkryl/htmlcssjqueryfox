         Many services have come and gone, but the two earliest, 
         Pocket and Instapaper, have remained under development and are 
         up to date. Evernote is an alternative, although it’s more of 
         a “junk drawer” service in letting you collect all kinds of things, 
         including clipping web articles, and then offers robust options 
         to search later.
